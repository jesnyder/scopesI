Thermal biology to forecast pathogen transmission dynamics 
Predict spatial and temporal spread of vector borne pathogen transmission 

The two most important abiotic factors of disease are temperature and water availability, which determine the abundance and distribution of arthropod vectors [Brown 2023]. Evidence suggests desiccation contributes to the decline of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission at warmer temperatures.


There is a range of temperatures where mosquitos achieve high transmission potential. Forecast 

* Temperature 
* Humidity 
* Relative humidity 
* UV Radiation 
* Water stress 
* Human-mediated environmental change 


The Aedes species of mosquito requires 

1. 8 months of drying out 
2. ??
