<p>Risk condition from climate &gt; Precense of vectors &gt; Infection &gt; Mortality &gt; Countermeasures </p>
<p>Thermal biology to forecast pathogen transmission dynamics 
Predict spatial and temporal spread of vector borne pathogen transmission </p>
<p>The two most important abiotic factors of disease are temperature and water availability, which determine the abundance and distribution of arthropod vectors [Brown 2023]. Evidence suggests desiccation contributes to the decline of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission at warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>There is a range of temperatures where mosquitos achieve high transmission potential. Forecast </p>
